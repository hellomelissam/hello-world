Hello GitHub-ians!

My name is Melissa.  I enjoy visualizing data and extrapolating stories out of chaos.  Oh, and I'm actively learning Python - any tips on learning sites/books will be greatly appreciated :)

Strange fact: I once lived in a warehouse loft that was evacuated by the FDNY because of an illegal matzo ball operation in the basement.
